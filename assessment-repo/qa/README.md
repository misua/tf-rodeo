# QA Engineer Assessment

## Objective

Demonstrate your ability to design and implement a comprehensive testing strategy for a modern web application.

## Tasks

### 1. Test Planning & Strategy (20 points)

- Review the provided application architecture
- Create a test strategy document covering:
  - Test levels (unit, integration, e2e)
  - Test types (functional, performance, security)
  - Test environment requirements
  - Risk assessment
  - Test priorities

### 2. Automated Testing Implementation (40 points)

Create automated tests using:

- Cypress or Playwright for E2E testing
- Jest for API testing
- k6 for performance testing

Required test scenarios:

```typescript
// Example E2E test structure
describe("User Application Flow", () => {
  it("should successfully submit application", () => {
    // Implementation
  });

  it("should handle validation errors", () => {
    // Implementation
  });

  it("should show appropriate loading states", () => {
    // Implementation
  });
});
```

### 3. CI/CD Integration (20 points)

- Set up GitHub Actions workflow for:
  - Running tests on PR
  - Test reporting
  - Coverage tracking
  - Performance benchmarking

### 4. Bug Reporting & Documentation (20 points)

- Use provided bug template
- Create clear reproduction steps
- Include relevant logs/screenshots
- Prioritize issues effectively
- Document test cases in Gherkin syntax
