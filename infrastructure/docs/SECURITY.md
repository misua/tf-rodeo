# Security Considerations

## Network Security

### VPC and Subnet Design
- ✅ Private subnets for RDS instances
- ✅ Public subnets only for NAT Gateway
- ✅ No direct internet access to database
- ✅ Network ACLs for subnet-level security

### Access Control
- ✅ Security groups with minimal required ports (5432)
- ✅ Source IP restrictions via CIDR blocks
- ✅ WAF rules for rate limiting and threat protection
- ✅ Regular security group rule audits

## Database Security

### Authentication and Access
- ✅ Strong password policy enforcement
- ✅ IAM authentication support
- ✅ Regular credential rotation
- ✅ Connection encryption via SSL/TLS

### Data Protection
- ✅ At-rest encryption using AWS KMS
- ✅ In-transit encryption enforced
- ✅ Automated backups with encryption
- ✅ Point-in-time recovery enabled

### Monitoring and Auditing
- ✅ CloudWatch alerts for suspicious activities
- ✅ Performance Insights for query monitoring
- ✅ Enhanced monitoring enabled
- ✅ Log retention and analysis

## Compliance and Best Practices

### AWS Best Practices
- ✅ Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
- ✅ Regular patching and updates
- ✅ Resource tagging for security classification
- ✅ Principle of least privilege in IAM roles

### Security Controls
1. **Prevention**
   - Network segmentation
   - WAF rules
   - Security groups
   - NACLs

2. **Detection**
   - CloudWatch alarms
   - Enhanced monitoring
   - Log analysis
   - Performance monitoring

3. **Response**
   - Incident response plan
   - Backup restoration procedures
   - Security patch deployment
   - Access revocation process

## Security Recommendations

### Short-term Improvements
1. Implement AWS Secrets Manager for credential management
2. Enable AWS GuardDuty for threat detection
3. Set up AWS Config rules for compliance monitoring
4. Implement regular security assessments

### Long-term Security Roadmap
1. Implement database proxy for connection pooling
2. Set up cross-region disaster recovery
3. Implement automated compliance checks
4. Develop comprehensive security runbooks

## Emergency Procedures

### Security Incident Response
1. Isolate affected resources
2. Review and analyze logs
3. Apply necessary security patches
4. Update security rules
5. Document and report incidents

### Access Management
1. Regular access review process
2. Emergency access revocation procedures
3. Break-glass procedures for emergencies
4. Audit trail maintenance
